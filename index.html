<h1><center><u>About The Lego Company</u></center></u></h1>

<p>
It is the LEGO® philosophy that ‘good quality play’ enriches
  a child’s life – and lays the foundation for later adult life. We
  believe that play is a key element in children’s growth and development
  and stimulates the imagination and the emergence of
  ideas and creative expression. All LEGO products are based
  on this underlying philosophy of learning and development
  through play.Only the best is good enough
  True to its motto ‘Only the best is good enough’, the LEGO
  Group has been emphasising the importance of high quality
  since 1932, where the founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen began
  making wooden toys. High quality and safe products have remained
  the focal point for the LEGO Group throughout the years -
  and it still is. LEGO products are tested rigorously to live up 
  to the strictest safety and quality standards
  as well as our own high expectations. This approach
  has made children and adults return to LEGO products time
  and again.
	Systematic creativity
LEGO bricks are all part of the LEGO system, which essentially
means that they can easily be combined in innumerable
ways – and just as easily be dismantled. The more LEGO
bricks you have, the more fertile your creativity can become.
The combination of a structured system, logic and unlimited
creativity encourages the child to learn through play in a
wholly unique LEGO fashion.
The LEGO Group wants to leave a positive impact – be it in
respect to the Group’s stakeholders or the wider community.
The LEGO Group is committed to caring for the environment
and the society that children will inherit, and to inspiring and
developing the builders of tomorrow.
