The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words "leg godt", meaning "play well". It’s our name and it’s our ideal.The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen. The company has passed from father to son and is now owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder.it has come a long way over the past almost 80 years - from a small carpenter’s workshop to a modern, global enterprise that is now one of the world’s largest manufacturers of toys.The LEGO brick is our most important product. We are proud to have been named “Toy of the Century” twice. Our products have undergone extensive development over the years – but the foundation remains the traditional LEGO brick.
The brick in its present form was launched in 1958. The interlocking principle with its tubes makes it unique and offers unlimited building possibilities. It's just a matter of getting the imagination going – and letting a wealth of creative ideas emerge through play.And play well they did. The company expanded from only six employees in 1934 to forty in 1942. LEGO was also fairly progressive, and became an early adopter of new technologies and materials. In fact, the group became the first Danish company to own a plastic injection-molding machine. When the Christiansens came across prototypes of a British toy called "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" in 1947, they adopted the idea and started manufacturing their own version two years later. The bricks had pegs on top and hollow bottoms, allowing children to lock the bricks together and create elaborate structures never possible with the simple wooden blocks of yesteryear.

<h1><u>The Lego Group</u></h1>
A commonly-cited statistic is that there are 102,981,500 possible combinations of 6-sided, 8-stud bricks. But that number only works if the final product is a tower that's six bricks tall. A computer program has helped reveal a more accurate number -- there are 915,103,765 possible 6-brick combinations.Although Lego has introduced several theme sets over the years, including House, Farm and Pirates, the company didn't create any licensed products until 1999. That's when Lego introduced "Star Wars" and "Winnie-the-Pooh" sets. But the decision to make licensed products wasn't an easy one for the company. Producing a set of elements that had a set purpose rather than being open-ended was completely contrary to the philosophy of open-ended building play. However, the "Star Wars sets quickly became the best-selling new product line in company history. The company's philosophy now is that these sets add storytelling to building play.
The current Lego product lines include licensed sets that portray characters and scenes from "Star Wars," D.C. Comics (including Batman), "Bob the Builder," "Thomas the Tank Engine" and Nick Jr. television shows like "Spongebob Squarepants." There are also numerous themed sets on the market as well as larger QUATRO and DUPLO bricks for infants and toddlers. But in spite of the popularity of all these product lines, the last few years haven't been easy for the Lego Group.The Lego Group's profits peaked in the mid-1990s. In 1998, the company reported a pre-tax loss. It had its first large-scale layoff in 1999, and in 2000 it lost about a billion Danish Kroner (about $120 million). Most analysts theorize that the new prevalence of electronic devices marketed to children, like MP3 players and video game systems, has caused part of the drop in sales. In addition, the Lego Group's major patents have expired, so competitors like Mega Bloks have been able to produce less-expensive sets that are compatible with Lego bricks. The introduction of the Friends line gave the company a significant boost in sales, but it came with a hefty dose of criticism that the sets reinforced sexist stereotypes.
