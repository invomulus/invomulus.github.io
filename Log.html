<h1><center><u>The importanance of Web Standards</u></center></h1>
<p>W3s standards define an open web platform fir application development that has much potential for the developers. However, HTML has boundaries a however HTML is slowly improving as time goes on. Web design and applications involve the standards for building and referencing pages , this section includes how to the pages more accessible to people with disabilities and making websites work on different devices such as phones and such devices , to implement that on a site can be tricky I believe there are many ways accessibility can be improve first I could add a button which makes the text bigger so itâ€™s easier to read , not only that but I could make it so a user can turn the colours of if they are colour-blind and make it so a user can use a narrator  which will read the text for him if he is bad of sight and I can add subtitles to all videos for those who are hard of hearing and deaf.W3C is focusing on software/technologies to enable web access anywhere such as on printers, televisions and even vehicles this is something I as a web creator can not control but the user can this would be with stuff such as having data such as 3g/4g on their phones and having built in 4g/3g on their cars as well. When it comes to web access on the printer this is only controlled by the user, if the user has a wireless printer they should have network on it .Web architecture is based on the sustain of the web including URLs and https, The creator of the website can keep their URLS sweet and simple so they are easy to find and use, for the https people can make sure there websites are secure when it comes to security.The services references to languages such as HTTP and xml and soap. The importance of web standards, The code can be Efficient as web standards brings efficient coding to web designs. Since all programming is not limited to the html downloads can be shorter as the javascript can be linked from a different page and the css can be also this makes loading times so much faster.The next is compatibility  whether it's a web page, an add-on, or a software application, almost every piece of programming passes through the hands of many different designers. Having an accepted standard of coding ensures that all programmers are speaking the same "language," and that code remains streamlined and efficient regardless of the author. Finally search engine compatibillity , all web debelopers want thier online content to be easier to search and bring up and revelant content in a user search it must scan the content with a web crawler.</p>
<h1><center><u>Web Standards</u></center></h1>
<p>
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the oldest web coding language. As such, it is the most common markup language used by web developers, and still forms a significant part of all online content. The use of HTML is governed by a set of syntax rules which, though fairly efficient, are also fairly lax. Elements are not case sensitive, closing tags are not strictly regulated, and shortcuts can be used for certain attributes. While basic HTML was the standard for many years, it has undergone several revisions, including HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.0. Its latest iteration is HTML5.
HTML5 is the latest iteration of the basic HTML markup language. It introduces some new rules and features, while discarding some of the elements from previous versions. HTML5 introduced new semantic elements and control attributes as well as several Application Programming Interfaces (API) that support drag and drop features, geolocation, and local storage that eliminates the use of cookies.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provide the mechanism by which changes in the appearance or position of online content can be assigned to a document's HTML or XHTML elements. The use of CSS defines the overall appearance of a website, and allows it to be remodeled quickly and efficiently. In short, the use of CSS allows web developers to more artfully control the formatting and layout of a document. This allows web developers to easily change backgrounds, alter fonts and text sizes, and reposition content on a web page. While much of this is possible with basic HTML, the use of CSS allows programmers and web developers to produce content that is underpinned by a more streamlined and efficient code.
JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language. It is primarily used to add behavior to a web page. It can be used to validate data on a form, provide drag-and-drop functions, enable button functions, and animate page elements. JavaScript is instrumental in making web pages more interactive, allowing them to more accurately respond to user events such as mouse clicks, page navigation, and inputted searches.

<h1><center><u>Strengths and weaknesses</u></center></h1>
<p>
The strengths of the current web practices standards and specifications are that the coder of the site must take disabilities into consideration when making the website this means everyone who may want to browse the website is accounted for when the are preparing to access the site.The next strength is the website can work usually on every device such as a phone a tablet as the website will usually scale to the resolution of whatever device is using it .Weaknesses: It can be difficult for a coder to keep to the standards and can make code longer which will increase website loading time. the other weakness is that HTML5 has its obvious limitions so there will be thngs you just cant do with the code but as time goes on the code is only gonna get better.

<h1><center><u>Best practices</u></center></h1>
<P>
My website Focus on audience:
My website is on Lego which would mean the website is suited for kids so for most pages I have add colourful texts and pictures and the navbar is easy to navigate 
My site also keeps with the brand and has nothing not to do with Lego as you can also see from the picture below. Keep with the theme of best practice I decided to make the website simply and easy to follow and not only that I decided to use high quality pictures and videos, so users can actually see and view them
